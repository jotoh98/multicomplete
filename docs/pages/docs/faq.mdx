# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does this work with x?

`multicomplete` is ui library agnostic. You bring your favourite component library and we provide some basic functionality.

## I want to keep selected options in the list. What do I do?

You can set the `filterOptions` config prop to `false`.
This will disable the filtering of selected options from the list.

Filtering by input query will still work.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For complete aria compliance, you should mark selected options with `aria-selected="true"`.
