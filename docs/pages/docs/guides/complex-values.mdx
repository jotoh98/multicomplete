# Complex Values

Dealing with complex values is easy with the `useMultiComplete` hook.

The hook has one generic argument, `TValue`, holding the value and option array item type.

In the most simple form, you can pass a simple array of `string` array to both the `options` and `values` fields and everything will work as expected.

For the hook to work correctly with more complex types, we can pass a few options. We’ll be able to

- make filtering the options by query possible and
- compare an option to a used value to filter it.

The configuration options of the main hook are:

```tsx {3,4} filename="UseMultiCompleteOptions.ts"
export type UseMultiCompleteOptions<TValue> = {
  // ...
  isEqual?: (a: TValue, b: TValue) => boolean
  queryOptionFilter?: (option: TValue, query: string) => boolean
  // ...
}
```


## isEqual

Two compare two values or options, the `isEqual` property is used. It’s  a predicate function getting two `TValue` items and returning a `boolean`. `true` in case the two items are equal, `false` otherwise,

B default, the function compares the two items by directly comparing them with the triple equality operator (`===`).

We use the function to compare an option against used values. If you pass the `filterValues` option with `true`  to the `useMultiComplete` hook (which is the case by default), the chosen values will be filtered from the options displayed in the popover.

## queryOptionFilter

The input is used to reduce the amount of options displayed in the popover. To achieve this, we have to filter out options with the query that we search for.

The option `queryOptionFilter` takes an `option` and the search query `string`. By then checking if the option fits the query, you can decide whether it will be displayed or not,

By default, the option will be cast to string and then a case insensitive substring comparison will be invoked:

```tsx
String(option).toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
```

## Example

Now, let’s try to implement the functions for data in the following format:

```tsx
type Item = {
  value: string
  label: string
}
```

This format may hold a machine readable, unique identifier in the `value` property, similar to the `value` property on an html `<option>` element and a human readable, displayed text in the `label` property.

Let’s imagine we define two items as equal, if their respective `value`s are equal and if we search for an item, it should trigger a case-insensitive search for a `label`.

With these requirements, our functions could look like this:

```tsx
const isEqual = (a: Item, b: Item) => a.value === b.value

const queryOptionFilter =
  (option: Item, query: string) => option.label.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
```

## Convenience Functions

To make the implementation of these functions easier, we also provides two convenience functions:

### createSubstringFilter

`createSubstringFilter` is a convenience wrapper around the `queryOptionsFilter` function.
It wraps a `toString` function around the given `option` and then compares the result with the query using a case-insensitive substring comparison.
Our implementation of `queryOptionFilter` from above is equivalent to:

```tsx
const queryOptionFilter = createSubstringFilter((option: Item) => option.label)
```

### createValueEquality

`createValueEquality` is a convenience wrapper around the `isEqual` function.
Given a function mapping the `TValue` to the value to compare, it returns a function comparing the values using the triple equality operator (`===`).
Our implementation of `isEqual` from above is equivalent to:

```tsx
const isEqual = createValueEquality((item: Item) => item.value)
```
