The testcases are defined in such a way that they represent the constraints defined in the [combobox specification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) by wai-aria.
We group them by the expected result achieved by several actions; one for each testcase.

The following tests are already implemented:
